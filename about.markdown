Red Team - Malware Development in the wild - Getting into Software Exploitation and Vulnerability Research

In 2023, I delved into malware development and EDR evasion techniques, leveraging both known and lesser-known methods to circumvent solutions from reputable companies. Additionally, I began participating in Purple Team and Red Team exercises, which I'm still actively engaged in.

In 2024, my focus has shifted towards exploit development and research, particularly in Windows and VMware internals. I'm gearing up to pursue the OSEE Offensive Security certification and enroll in the Windows Heap Exploitation (Advanced) course offered by Corelan. Concurrently, I continue to explore bypasses for Windows' existing protections and investigate potential exploitation avenues within popular EDRs.
